To do this, we recommend [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install), which is an effective tool for python package management that can create virtual environments, comes with a pre-installed IDE, and includes all of the Jupyter functionality that you'll see here.  The Anaconda installer should be detailed on the page linked above, but here's [another resource](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/) for installation that might be helpful."

    "Lastly, note that Jupyter notebooks are becoming increasingly popular as tools to supplement publication.  As a computational researcher, you can provide explicit documentation of your methods with embedded code that actually works for a person who wants to understand better what you're working on.  In my own work, I've begun making all my plots and collecting all of my data in Jupyter notebooks to provide as supporting info for each of my recent papers.  It's a bit more work, but you'll find that having this level of organization and being this transparent about your methods goes a long way.\n",
